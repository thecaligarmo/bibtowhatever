# bibtowhatever
Converts bibtex to different output formats.

## Requirements
This tool requires `bibtexparser` and Python 3+. For more information on `bibtexparser`, you can check out [bibtexparser docs](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

## How to use
Place bib in the same directory as these files. Edit `bibtex.py` and update the customizations in the top. Run using python and enjoy.

## Future releases
I'd eventually like this to sit on top of `bibtexparser` so that you don't need to edit a file to handle things, instead allowing for just a calling of a method. This is more of a "proof of concept" for now.
